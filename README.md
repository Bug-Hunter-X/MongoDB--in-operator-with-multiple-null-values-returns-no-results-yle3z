# MongoDB $in operator with multiple null values
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with multiple null values.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator, when used with an array containing multiple `null` values, does not return the expected results.  Even if the field in the documents contains `null`, the query may not return those documents.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a MongoDB query that reproduces the bug.  Run this script to observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle this situation.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly query for documents containing `null` values using the `$in` operator, addressing the limitations of the operator when dealing with multiple `null` values. Note that this issue is specific to multiple nulls - a single null will work correctly.
